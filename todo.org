* HTTP parsing
** figure out how HTTP works for sysnet page
*** DONE figure out how to see requests
*** DONE read the whole link on http
** start writing parser
*** HTTPMessage

** think about to structure parsing
   probably just a composition of small parsing functions that
   move a char pointer forward in the buffer
* performance testing
** look up how to test server
** ask Jeannie about PlanetLab
